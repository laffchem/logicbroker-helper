If you have python installed you're good to go.

### How to use

When Risk asks you to hold a bunch of orders, you have either the calypso links or the ids.

Paste their request into the "risk-values.txt" file as is.

Run the program and select the values.

1. Calypso links
2. Ids

Paste the output into the query and you are good to go.
